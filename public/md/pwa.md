## PWA

Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

- Reliable
- Fast
- Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling
- Engaging
- Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience

This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.

#### In Depth

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.

Functionality includes working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices. Since they are a type of webpage or website known as a web application,

Key concept: There is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play.

#### Real world

This is an imagined conversation between me and Bob, Me being a front-end software engineer with 20 years of real world dev experience and a healthy scepticism that the kind of business person I'm talking to really has the ability, authority, agency, skill or will to actually implement what I'm talking about, even if they understand it enough to see why they should do it.

Bob, for imagination's sake is my boss's boss. He's an owner & technical decision maker of a smallish company of 15 people who already operate a tech business which actually makes some money. He's quite smug about that.

The business already has a desktop site, an android app and an iPhone app. None of which really get used :) There are 3 separate code bases for each of those applications, requiring a team of at least 3 developers to maintain. My role here is the bottom of the pile. I'm a contractor whose ideas about how the entire business should be turned on its head to make it better are correctly viewed with as much scepticism as I have of them.

Even if this conversation were real, there is nowhere is can really go. No company is going to take the risk to rock the boat that they've spent years patching together. Fair enough. Would you?
